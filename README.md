Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! Each year, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) brings coding enthusiasts together for 25 days of fun and challenging programming puzzles. Here's my journey through the 2024 edition.

## 📆 Progress

Here’s a checklist to track my progress through the days. Each day consists of two parts. 

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| Day 1  | ✅  | ✅  | Warm-up puzzle |
| Day 2  | ✅  | ✅  | Took way too long! |
| Day 3  | ✅  | ✅  | Not regex noooooo |
| Day 4  | ✅  | ✅  | Grids will take us apart, again. |
| Day 5  | ✅  | ✅  | Never implemented an IComparer before.  |
| Day 6  | ✅  | ✅  | Kind of brute force solution for part 2, but just happy i solved it honestly.|
| Day 7  | ✅  | ✅  | The use of funcs really payed off in part 2, only small change needed |
| Day 8  | ✅  | ✅  | Antennas! Had a radio-engineer over for dinner when solving this one, what a coincidence |
| Day 9  | ⬜  | ⬜  | |
| Day 10 | ⬜  | ⬜  | |
